In each folder add the certificates and keys generated from the Development/Production SSL certificate from Apple's iOS Dev Center.

There should be 4 files in each folder. They should be named as follows:

cert-classcast.pem
cert-classcatcher.pem
key-classcast.pem
key-classcatcher.pem

See https://github.com/argon/node-apn/wiki/Preparing-Certificates as a guide to preparing the keys and certificates.
